## Housing Data Analysis Notebook
This Jupyter Notebook contains code for analyzing and visualizing housing data. The notebook uses Python and popular data analysis libraries such as pandas and matplotlib to load, explore, and visualize the dataset.

## Notebook Content
### Loading the Data:

The notebook starts by loading the housing data from a CSV file named housing.csv using the pandas library.

The dataset includes various features such as longitude, latitude, housing_median_age, total_rooms, total_bedrooms, population, households, median_income, median_house_value, and ocean_proximity.


### Data Exploration:

The first few rows of the dataset are displayed using the head() function to get an initial look at the data.

A subset of the dataset is created by selecting specific columns (longitude, latitude, median_house_value) for further analysis.

### Data Visualization:

The notebook includes code to create a scatter plot of the housing data, using longitude and latitude as the x and y axes, respectively. The median_house_value is used to color the points, providing a visual representation of housing prices across different locations.

### Further Analysis:

Additional analysis and visualizations can be added to explore relationships between different features, such as the distribution of median_income or the correlation between total_rooms and median_house_value.

## Libraries Used
### Pandas:
For data manipulation and analysis.

### Matplotlib:
For creating visualizations.
